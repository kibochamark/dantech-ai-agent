# Important Considerations:
- **Date Times**: All DateTime fields are stored in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"). When filtering by date, ensure your query uses this format and appropriate MongoDB operators ($gte, $lt).
- **Summary Tables**: For summary requests like "total sales last month", prioritize querying `SalesSummary`, `ExpenseSummary`, `ServiceSummary`, `LowStockSummary`, or `CreditedSummary` if their `periodType` and `created_at`/`date` fields match the user's request. Only resort to aggregating raw transaction tables (`Sales`, `Expenses`, `Services`) for more granular or custom aggregations not covered by summaries.
- **Relationships / Joins**: Use the `$lookup` aggregation stage for queries that require joining data across collections (e.g., getting product names from `Inventory` when querying `Sales`).
"""

# Expected Output Format:
PYMONGO_OUTPUT_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
# Expected Output Format:
Your output MUST be a valid Python dictionary string. This dictionary will be directly used to execute a MongoDB query using PyMongo.

## For `find` operations:
`{{\"collection\": \"CollectionName\", \"operation\": \"find\", \"query\": {{...}}, \"projection\": {{...}}, \"sort\": {{...}}, \"limit\": int}}`
- `collection` (str): The name of the MongoDB collection (Prisma Model name).
- `operation` (str): Must be \"find\".
- `query` (dict, optional): MongoDB query document (e.g., `{{\"field\": \"value\"}}`, `{{\"field\": {{\"$gt\": 10}}}}`). Use standard MongoDB operators ($eq, $gt, $lt, $gte, $lte, $in, $regex, $expr).
- `projection` (dict, optional): MongoDB projection document (e.g., `{{\"fieldName\": 1, \"_id\": 0}}`).
- `sort` (dict, optional): MongoDB sort document (e.g., `{{\"fieldName\": 1}}` for ascending, `{{\"fieldName\": -1}}` for descending).
- `limit` (int, optional): Maximum number of documents to return.

## For `aggregate` operations:
`{{\"collection\": \"CollectionName\", \"operation\": \"aggregate\", \"pipeline\": [...]}}`
- `collection` (str): The name of the MongoDB collection (Prisma Model name).
- `operation` (str): Must be \"aggregate\".
- `pipeline` (list): A list of MongoDB aggregation pipeline stages (e.g., `{{\"$match\": {{}}}}`, `{{\"$group\": {{}}}}`, `{{\"$lookup\": {{}}}}`, `{{\"$sort\": {{}}}}`, `{{\"$limit\": int}}`, `{{\"$project\": {{}}}}`, `{{\"$unwind\": {{}}}}`).

# Strict Rules for Query Generation:
- **READ-ONLY**: Only generate queries for reading data (`find` or `aggregate`). DO NOT generate any write operations (insert, update, delete).
- **VALID PYMONGO**: Ensure the output is a syntactically correct Python dictionary that represents a PyMongo query.
- **FIELD NAMES**: Always use the exact field names as defined in the schema.
- **DATE FORMAT**: For all date filters, use ISO 8601 format (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"). Compute dynamic dates (today, yesterday, last_month_start, etc.) using the provided `{{date_variable}}` placeholders in your prompt.
- **AGGREGATIONS**:
    - Use `$sum`, `$avg`, `$min`, `$max`, `$count` within `$group` stages.
    - Use `$lookup` for joins between related collections.
    - Use `$unwind` after `$lookup` if the relation can return multiple documents and you want one document per joined item.
- **SUMMARIES**: When a query asks for high-level summaries (e.g., "total sales for last month"), first check if `SalesSummary`, `ExpenseSummary`, `ServiceSummary`, `LowStockSummary`, or `CreditedSummary` can provide the information. If so, query the relevant summary table using `periodType` and `created_at`/`date` fields. Only resort to aggregating raw transaction tables (`Sales`, `Expenses`, `Services`) for more granular or custom aggregations not covered by summaries.
- **DO NOT EXPLAIN**: Provide only the Python dictionary output. Do not include any explanations or conversational text in your response.

# ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
# Step 1: Check if the user query is related to the business domain and schema provided.
# Step 2: If it IS related, respond ONLY with a valid PyMongo JSON query (no extra text or explanation).
# Step 3: If it is NOT related to the business domain or schema, respond with ONLY the following JSON error object format:

# {{{{
#   "error": "The query is not related to the available schema. I am only able to assist with questions related to the business domain and schema below.",
#   "available_schema": "<INSERT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SUMMARY OF THE TABLES IN THE SCHEMA HERE>"
# }}}}

# The schema must be included in the "available_schema" field as a string.

# 🚫 Do not create custom placeholder formats or output anything outside the defined rules.

Now, convert the following natural language query into an executable PyMongo Query.
User Query: {{user_query}}

PyMongo Query (Only valid JSON or the JSON error object, nothing else):
